This is my first hands-on experience with web automation.

The aim/idea of this project is to easen the burden of prospective students who needs to check the institute portal almost on a daily basis for knowing the update on admission decision.

The experiment is performed on UNCC admission portal.And the implementation varies university to university.

This script is at a very rudimentary stage, there can be lot of improvements perormed like:
* Adding encryption to password input
* email notifications to user
* scheduler for timely execution
* implement NLP on the admit letter
